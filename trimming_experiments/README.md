# Overview

The file "trimming_exp_script.py" contains codes used for the trimming experiment, and the file "mhic_script.sh" is the shell script we used for running mHi-C (https://github.com/keleslab/mHiC). Besides, as we mentioned in our manuscript, LLC-HiC used for the trimming experiment is slightly different from that used for other experiments, therefore we put the codes here ("model_repeat_remap_trimming.py", "LRCC_part_1_trimming.py", "LRCC_part_2_trimming.py").
